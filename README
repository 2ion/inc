inc - manipulate unsigned integers in strings

Invocation:
    inc <verblist> <string>
        Applies <verlist> onto <string>, printing the result to stdout.
    inc -c <string>
        Prints a modified copy of <string> where
            * all recognized numbers are in bright/bold yellow and
            * the numbers' occurences are prefixed with their individual
              number_index values,
        so that if the string is long, it is still easy to formulate a
        verblist.
    inc -h
        Prints this message and exits.

Where:
    <verblist>  := ',' <verb1> ',' <verb2> [...] ',' <verbN>
    <verb>      := [+-]?<number_index>[+-=]<number_delta>[/<digitcount>]
    <string>    := A string with at least a single digit character. At
                   this point, all numbers will be parsed *UNSIGNED*.

Examples:
    inc ,-1+5 $string
        Increment the first last number by 5
    
    inc ,-2-3 $string
        Decrement the second last number by 3

    inc ,1-3,-2-4 $string
        Decrement the first number by 3 and decrement the second
        last number by 4.

    inc ,+1+3,3=4 $string
        Increment the first number by 3 and set the third number
        to 4.

    inc ,1+3,3=4/7 $string
        Increment the first number by 3 and set the third number
        to 4, and express the 3rd number as a 7 digit number, ie.
        `0000004`.

Return values:
    0 in case of success, 1 in case of failure
